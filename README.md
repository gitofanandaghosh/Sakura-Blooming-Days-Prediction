# Sakura-Blooming-Days-Prediction
If you ever dreamed of visiting Japan, the best season is spring, when you can see the bloom of Sakura (the world-famous cherry blossom). However, you might need a little bit of luck. Sakura blooms only for a short period of time; seven days after the flowers open, they already start to scatter. We consider building a bloom-date prediction model for the case of sakura in Tokyo. We have to fit the model to the data from the training years(1961 to 2017 (Excluding 1966, 1971, 1985, 1994, and 2008 ), then use the model to predict the bloom date for each of the test years(1966, 1971, 1985, 1994, and 2008). Three models to be applied to the data are described below.     


1. Prediction using the "600 Degree Rule"   
2. Linear Regression Model: Transform to Standard Temperature   
3. Predicting Bloom-date via Neural Network
